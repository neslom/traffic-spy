# traffic-spy

Traffic Spy was a group project at the Turing School of Software Development and Design built with Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record.

It is an application that monitors site usage - much like Google Analytics - and provides a web interface for users to see a visualization of their site's web traffic.

The team: [Markus Olsen](https://github.com/neslom), [Paul Grever](https://github.com/paulgrever), and [Dustin Gault](https://github.com/DSynergy).
